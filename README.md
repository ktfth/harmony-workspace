# Harmony Workspace

## Description

This a experimental project, without any kind of intention to transform in a profitable project.

On the directory:

* harmony-engine

You gonna encounter the main project, remember to change `.env.example` to .env and change the binary place on `config.toml`.

After that remember to use on `fixtures` the `.sql` file to start the database.

Have a happy hacking!
